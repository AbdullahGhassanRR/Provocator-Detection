# Provocator-Detection
Given social media comment dataset, exploit bad sentiment provocator for certain topics.  This system uses both text classification and topic modelling to detect the provocator 

Several files for the system included:
1. experiment.ipynb : a file where experiment (such as exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, modelling, model evaluating, algorithm testing) is conducted.
2. backend.py : a FastAPI backend to run logical provocator detection algorithm.
3. frontend.py: a Streamlit frontent for user interface and receive output result from backend.
